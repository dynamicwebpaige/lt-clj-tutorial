Based on teaching materials used during ClojureBridge tutorials:

# Brainstorming 
- The basics: arithmetic, arrays / lists, vectors, functions, if/else statements, Booleans, strings, etc.
- Pick a number, anagrams, animations?
- Reading files, pulling columnar data from a single file / series of files?
- Sorting algorithms (insertion, merge, quick, selection...)
- Also include how to make a basic Quil app.

# Out of Scope
- cljs, because David Nolen is amazing
- integration with (most) API's
